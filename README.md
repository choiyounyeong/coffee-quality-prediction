#### CSCA 5632 Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning

# Final project: Coffee Quality Prediction
***

### Project Summary
This project aims to build a predictive model for estimating the total cup points, a comprehensive metric of coffee quality, based on influencing factors. This is the final assignment for the CSCA 5632 course.

We will conduct data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to inspect, visualize, and cleanse the data. The project will employ an unsupervised approach(K means clustering) to discover structures or patterns within the data without relying on predefined labels, thereby understanding the underlying segmentation. Lastly, we will use a supervised approach to predict the 'Total Cup Points' for the dataset.

### Data Source

The data is sourced from the [Coffee Quality Data (CQI May-2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihb/coffee-quality-data-cqi?select=df_arabica_clean.csv)

It includes one CSV file (df_arabica_clean), which is publicly accessible. The file size is 115 KB and contains 41 columns and 208 rows in total.
